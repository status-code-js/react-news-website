It is still a niche market, with a certain risk for private investors. But together we can create a better world. The recent crash of the popular cryptocurrency exchange FTX has intensified a very important political and economic war over decentralized finance, which has been dragging on for years and still has a long way to go, because the stakes are colossal. What we are playing is nothing less than financial freedom, forcing traditional banking to reinvent itself or disappear. We are also cutting off wild capitalism that has settled in a poisonous financial world, with a drift that can be lethal.",

In 2015, the World Health Organization published a report that linked regular consumption of red meat and processed meat with an increased risk of suffering from different types of cardiovascular diseases, such as hypertension or cholesterol, and corrective cancer. Although it is true that said report did not advise against its consumption, it did recommend moderating it to once or twice a week.

Alcohol is an essential component of wine, contributing to its structure and flavor. However, alcohol is a potentially addictive substance that, when consumed in excess, can have negative consequences for people's health, happiness, and financial security. Talking about alcohol as a drug or alcohol and other drugs is, in addition to being false, counterproductive in terms of drug prevention efforts. Alcohol per se is not harmful to health. Abuse and excessive consumption that we all reject is counterproductive. The inclusion of alcohol in the drug concept is also very detrimental in terms of prevention. It trivializes the concept of drugs and reduces the perception of their risk, also favoring inappropriate consumption among the youngest, for example. Responsible, sensible and moderate consumption by adults allows alcohol to be perfectly compatible with a healthy life. Even scientists and doctors have corroborated the beneficial cardiovascular effects of ethanol or alcohol of agricultural origin present in all alcoholic beverages.",

Recently, a person to whom I did a coaching process, a year and a half ago, told me: \"You helped me a lot.\" When we started the process, he had just made the decision to leave his job, as a result of a stressful situation sustained over time that he did not know how to manage and that even led him to fall ill. So, he decided to train in the Human Resources area, with the aim of reorienting his professional career towards that field. Her goal was to be a second version of herself, and when we met again, she told me: \"I've done it!\" \"And what have you done to get it?\" I asked. She answered me: “Change me. I have changed a lot to be a better person and to survive; and the coaching process helped me a lot”. Many times, coaches are left with the question of whether we have helped our client in his desire for transformation and my reflection, the result of my experience, is that those people who want to change, achieve it.

                    text: "Es importante que los padres inculquen habilidades financieras a sus hijos desde que son capaces de comprender algunos conceptos básicos. Esto les ayudará a que el día de mañana, puedan tomar buenas decisiones. En España sigue siendo tabú hablar de dinero tanto con familiares y amigos como con compañeros de trabajo, ya sea por desconocimiento o inseguridad, evitamos los temas de conversación relacionados con nuestras finanzas. Pero el dinero es algo presente en nuestro día a día y contar con una buena cultura financiera nos ayudará a afrontar las diferentes situaciones que se puedan dar en nuestra vida. Para ello, es fundamental empezar a hablar el dinero de forma natural, empezando en casa con nuestros hijos.",

                    text: "Cuando una persona realmente quiere cambiar su vida, puede hacerlo. Y el coaching es, sencillamente, una herramienta para conseguir ese objetivo. Recientemente, una persona a la que le hice un proceso de coaching, hace un año y medio, me dijo: “Me ayudaste mucho”. Cuando iniciamos el proceso, acababa de tomar la decisión de dejar su trabajo, como consecuencia de una situación de estrés sostenido en el tiempo que no supo gestionar y que le llevó, incluso, a enfermar. Entonces, decidió formarse en el área de Recursos Humanos, con el objetivo de reorientar su carrera profesional hacia ese campo. Su objetivo era ser una segunda versión de ella misma y, cuando nos reencontramos, me dijo: “¡Lo he conseguido!”. “¿Y qué has hecho para conseguirlo?”, le pregunté. Ella me contestó: “Cambiar yo. He cambiado mucho para ser mejor persona y para sobrevivir; y el proceso de coaching me ayudó mucho”. Muchas veces los coachs nos quedamos con la duda de si habremos ayudado a nuestro cliente en su deseo de transformación y mi reflexión, fruto de mi experiencia, es que aquellas personas que quieren cambiar, lo consiguen.

                    text: "La tecnología está impulsando un sistema financiero basado en “blockchain” que podría dejar fuera de juego a los delincuentes y especuladores en la sombra. Aún es un mercado de nicho, de cierto riesgo para inversores privados. Pero podemos crear entre todos un mundo mejor. El hundimiento reciente de la popular plataforma de intercambio de criptomonedas FTX ha intensificado una muy importante guerra política y económica por las finanzas descentralizadas, que viene arrastrándose desde hace años y aún tiene mucho recorrido por delante, porque los intereses en juego son colosales. Lo que nos estamos jugando es nada menos que la libertad financiera, obligando a la banca tradicional a reinventarse o desaparecer. También estamos cortando el paso al capitalismo salvaje que se ha instalado en un mundo financiero ponzoñoso, con una deriva que puede ser letal.",
